# DocsAfterDark Reborn

Currently DocsAfterDark is going through a major refactoring/rewrite.

## Todo

- [ ] Move from CSS to SCSS and compile all stylesheets into a single one
- [ ] Control themeing with HTML element classes instead of inserting/removing link elements
- [ ] Move from JS to TypeScript for code clarity
- [ ] Reuse code with ES modules and cleaner code separation
